Simple Chat app with real time communication
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task Overview:
Build a real-time chat application where users can join chat rooms, send
messages, and see when other users are typing. The app should support
multiple chat rooms and display chat history.
Requirements:
● Frontend: Use React and Socket.IO (or WebSockets) for real-time
communication.
● Backend: Use Node.js with Express to handle API requests and
WebSocket communication for the chat feature.
● Database: Use any database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store
chat messages and user data.
● Core Features:
○ User Authentication: Implement a simple authentication system
(e.g., JWT) where users can log in or sign up.
○ Real-Time Messaging: Enable users to join a chat room and
exchange messages in real-time.
○ Chat History: Persist chat messages in the database and allow
users to retrieve the chat history when they join a room.
○ Typing Indicator: Show a real-time typing indicator when a user
is typing a message in the chat room.
Bonus:
● Implement multiple chat rooms with the ability to switch between rooms.
● Allow users to create private rooms or direct message other users.
● Implement push notifications for new messages when a user is not in
the chat room
